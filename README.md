# Ask A Dev Mobile Client

## Pipe Dream Features

* Mentees can find local events
* Mentees can subscribe to locations
* Admins can send push notifications to users based on Location subscriptions
* Use Meetup.com API (assuming it exists) to coordinate events. 

## Flutter, Technology and Development

The client is created with Flutter. Flutter is written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). 

Flutter is a cross-platform framework that doesn't suck. Dart is a client side language that doesn't look like Frankenstein's Monster. (*cough* javascript *cought*) 

If you're familiar with any reactive-style framework (React, Vue, Angular), Flutter will feel like home.

### Get Started

First, install Flutter. 

It's super easy, [here's the official guide for OSX](https://flutter.io/setup-macos/).

One you've installed Flutter, if everything has gone well:

```text
git clone https://github.com/askadev/askadev-mobile-client.git
cd ask_a_dev_mobile
flutter run
```

### IDE

I **highly** recommend that you use Intellij Idea (free edition works!) or VS Code for doing Dart and Flutter work. Both have incredible plugings maintained by the Google itself.

**Disclaimer**: I can't guarantee the dev experience of anyone who doesn't use one of these editors.

### Get Un-stuck

[The Flutter Channel on Gitter](https://gitter.im/flutter/flutter) is super active. Flutter Core Team peeps seem to always been in there, and can answer any question. 
[The Flutter Docs](https://flutter.io/docs/) are literally the best I've ever seen.
